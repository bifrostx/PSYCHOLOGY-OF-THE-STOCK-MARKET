## I - The Speculative Cycle/一、投机周期

Most experienced professional traders in the stock market will readily admit that the minor fluctuations, amounting to perhaps five or ten dollars a share in the active speculative issues, are chiefly psychological. They result from varying attitudes of the public mind, or, more strictly, from the mental attitudes of those persons who are interested in the market at the time.

大部分有经验的专业股票交易员将容易同意以下观点：在一个活跃的股票投机市场中，其轻微波动，例如5到10美元，主要取决于人们的心理。这些小波动来自于大众的各种不同心态，或者更严格的说，来自于那些当前对股票市场感兴趣的人们的心态。

Such fluctuations may be, and often are, based on "fundamental" conditions - that is , on real changes in the dividend prospects of the stocks affected or on variations in the earning power of the corporations represented - and again they may not. The broad movements of the market, covering periods of months or even years, are always the result of general financial conditions; but the smaller intermediate fluctuations represent changes in the state of the public mind, which may or may not coincide with alterations in basic factors.

这些波动可能是，也经常是，基于"基本面"的（即基于对股息预期的实际变化或股票所代表公司的盈利能力的变化），也可能并不是。股市中持续数月甚至数年的价格变化总是大体财务状况变化的结果，但是短期波动则代表了大众的心态，他们通常不一定随“基本面”同步变化。

To bring out clearly the degree to which psychology enters into the stock market problem from day to day, it is only necessary to reproduce a conversation between professional traders such as may be hear almost any day in New street or in the neighboring cafes.

为了清楚说明心理学对每天股票市场的影响程度，我们只需重复一下华尔街或其附近咖啡厅中的专业股票交易员之间几乎每天可闻的谈话即可。

”Well, what do you know?" says one trader to the other.

“诶，有什么消息吗？”，一个交易员对另一个交易员说。

"Just covered my Steel," is the reply. "Too much company. Everybody seems to be short."

”刚回补了钢铁“，另一个交易员回答道，“太多公司了，似乎大家都在做空。”

"Everybody I've seen thinks just as you do. Each one has covered because he thinks everybody else is short—still the market doesn't rally much. I don't believe there's much short interest left, and if that's the case we shall get another break."

“每个我见到的人都和你想的一样，都回补了，大家觉得其他所有人都在做空，虽然市场反弹不会太大。我不觉得做空还有多少利润，假如确实如此，我们就又可以休息一阵子了。”

"Yes, that's what they all say—and they've all sold short again because they think everybody else has covered. I believe there's just as much short interest now as there was before."

“是的，大家都这么说，然后他们又开始做空了，因为大家觉得其他人都开始回补了。我认为做空还能获得何之前差不多的利润。”
