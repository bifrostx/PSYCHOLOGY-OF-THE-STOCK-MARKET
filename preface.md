# PREFACE/前言

This book is based upon the belief that the movements of prices on the exchanges are dependent to a very large degree on the mental attitude of the investing and trading public. It is the result of years of study and experience as fellow at Columbia University, news writer, statistician, on the editorial staff of THE MAGAZINE OF WALL STREET, etc.

本书基于这样一个信念，即股票市场的价格变动很大程度上和股民们的心理状态是相关的。这个结论是哥伦比亚大学学者、新闻作者、统计学家、华尔街杂志编辑等多人的学习及工作经验的结晶。

The book is intended chiefly as a practical help to that considerable part of the community which is interested, directly or indirectly, in the markets; but it is hoped that it may also have some scientific value as a preliminary discussion in a new field, where opportunities for further research seem almost unlimited.

本书的主要目的是给那些为数不少的直接或间接对股市感兴趣的人一些实际帮助，同时，我们也希望本书能作为一种初步探讨对这个新兴领域带来一点科学价值。目前看来，未来对此领域的研究机会还非常多。
